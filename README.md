# React Hooks
This is a short introduction about React Hooks.

To get started, first install all dependencies:
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm install -g reveal-md
```

To run the presentation, type:
```bash
$ reveal-md slides.md
```

To generate a PDF version of the slides, type:
```bash
$ reveal-md slides.md --print slides.pdf
```
or directly append `?print-pdf` to the browsers URL (don't forget to remove slide numbers like #/1 eg.). Then execute the print command in your browser.
